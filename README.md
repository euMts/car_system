Description<br>

Nork-Town is a weird place. Crows cawk the misty morning while old men squint. <br>

It’s a small town, so the mayor had a bright idea to limit the number of cars a person may possess. <br>

<br>

One person may have up to 3 vehicles. <br>

The vehicle, registered to a person, may have one color, ‘yellow’, ‘blue’ or ‘gray’. <br>

And one of three models, ‘hatch’, ‘sedan’ or ‘convertible’.<br>

<br>

Carford car shop want a system where they can add car owners and cars. <br>

Car owners may not have cars yet, they need to be marked as a sale opportunity.<br>

Cars cannot exist in the system without owners.<br>
